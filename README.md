## General Info

Communism Simulator is a simple seeming game in which you control a town.

Normally, the readme would now proceed to tell teach you the rules of the game, but
**this game is meant to be played without knowledge of the mechanics.**

However, since you asked so nicely, I will say that the win condition is met when you have 3000 rubles in you wallet.

The game is pretty easy to beat; a friend did it on one of his first tries.
So I created several secret endings that you can reach in all sorts of ways.

Good luck :)

## Credits

This was a weekend-long project created by me (obviously).
It's meant to be a simple game to kickstart my Github "career".
I will be making (hopefully) many more games and adding them to this account.
