## General Info

Communism Simulator is a simple seeming game in which you control a town.

I would usually now proceed to tell you the mechanics, but
**This game is meant to be played without knowledge of the mechanics.**

However, since you asked so nicely, I'll inform you of this:
The win condition is met when you have 3000 rubles in you wallet.

The game is actually pretty easy to beat; my friend did it on one of his first tries.
So I created several secret endings that you can reach in all sorts of ways.
My hint is to either make a variable huge or really small when you finish the game.

Good luck :)

## Credits

This was a weekend-long project created by me (obviously).
It's meant to be a simple game to kickstart my Github "career".
I will be making (hopefully) many more games and adding them to this account.

I used the create-react-app boilerplate to build the groundwork for the app.
You can learn more in the [Create React App documentation](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/getting-started).

If you would like to learn how to make these for yourself, check out the [React documentation](https://reactjs.org/).
